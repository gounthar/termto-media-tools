# Command Line Alternatives to Ray.so for Light-Theme Code Images

Yes, there are excellent command line tools that can replicate ray.so's functionality with superior light themes optimized for well-lit presentation environments[^10][^15][^16]. These CLI alternatives offer automatic language detection, customizable light backgrounds, and direct PNG/SVG output for seamless PowerPoint integration[^10][^11][^14].

## Top Recommended Tools

### Silicon: The Performance Leader

Silicon stands out as the fastest and most reliable option for generating presentation-ready code images[^10][^11]. Built in Rust, it processes code snippets significantly faster than browser-based alternatives while working completely offline[^10]. The tool automatically detects over 100 programming languages from file extensions and supports manual language specification using simple flags like `-l python` or `-l javascript`[^10][^46].

For light themes optimal for presentations, Silicon offers several professional options including GitHub, InspiredGitHub, Solarized Light, and Tomorrow themes[^10][^33]. The tool excels at creating high-contrast images with white backgrounds and dark syntax highlighting, perfect for projector visibility[^10].

### Freeze: Modern Aesthetics with Interactive Configuration

Freeze, developed by Charm, delivers beautiful modern code images with excellent light theme support[^15]. The tool features an interactive configuration mode that allows real-time theme preview and adjustment[^15]. Its GitHub light theme and Visual Studio light themes provide exceptional readability in bright environments[^15].

Language detection in Freeze operates automatically based on file extensions, with manual override options available through the `--language` parameter[^15]. The tool supports all major programming languages and can even capture terminal output for dynamic code demonstrations[^15].

### Carbon-now-cli: Familiar Interface with Cloud Power

Carbon-now-cli replicates the exact functionality of carbon.now.sh through command line automation[^14][^16][^22]. It provides access to all Carbon themes, including presentation-optimized light themes like Seti, Base16-light, and GitHub[^14][^22]. The tool maintains the same high-quality output and language detection accuracy as the web version[^16][^22].

## Language Detection Capabilities

All three tools provide robust automatic language detection through multiple mechanisms[^10][^15][^16]. File extensions serve as the primary detection method, with tools recognizing common patterns like `.py` for Python, `.js` for JavaScript, and `.rs` for Rust[^10][^46]. Advanced content analysis examines shebang lines and syntax patterns for files without clear extensions[^10][^23].

When automatic detection fails, manual language specification remains straightforward across all platforms[^10][^15][^16]. Silicon uses `-l <language>`, Freeze employs `--language <language>`, and Carbon-now-cli typically detects correctly but supports theme-based language hints[^10][^15][^16].

## Presentation-Optimized Configuration

For maximum visibility in well-lit presentation environments, specific configuration ensures optimal contrast and readability[^10]. Silicon achieves this through white backgrounds (`#ffffff`), GitHub themes, and carefully configured shadow settings[^10]. Freeze accomplishes similar results with its built-in GitHub light theme and customizable background colors[^15].

The recommended approach involves consistent font selection, typically JetBrains Mono or similar programming fonts, with font sizes between 16-18 points for projector visibility[^10]. Removing window controls and decorative elements maximizes code area while maintaining professional appearance[^10][^15].

## Installation and Basic Usage

Installing these tools varies by platform but remains straightforward across operating systems[^10][^15][^16]. Silicon installs via Cargo (`cargo install silicon`), Homebrew (`brew install silicon`), or package managers like pacman on Arch Linux[^10]. Freeze installation occurs through Homebrew (`brew install charmbracelet/tap/freeze`) or Go installation commands[^15].

Carbon-now-cli requires Node.js and installs globally via npm (`npm install -g carbon-now-cli`) or Yarn[^16][^22]. Each tool provides different strengths: Silicon for speed and offline operation, Freeze for modern aesthetics and interactivity, and Carbon-now-cli for familiar Carbon.now.sh compatibility[^10][^15][^16].

## PowerPoint Integration Workflow

The generated PNG and SVG files integrate seamlessly into PowerPoint presentations through standard image insertion methods[^10]. PNG format provides the most reliable compatibility across PowerPoint versions, while SVG offers scalability advantages for high-resolution displays[^10][^15][^16].

Best practices include testing images on actual presentation equipment, maintaining consistent themes across all code images, and ensuring sufficient contrast for back-row visibility[^10]. The tools support batch processing for multiple code files, streamlining presentation preparation workflows[^10].

These command line alternatives provide superior control, speed, and customization compared to online tools while delivering professional-quality code images perfectly suited for presentation environments. The combination of automatic language detection, extensive light theme support, and offline operation makes them ideal replacements for web-based code image generators[^10][^15][^16].
