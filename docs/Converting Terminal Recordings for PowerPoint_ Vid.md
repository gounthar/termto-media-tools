# Converting Terminal Recordings for PowerPoint: Video Solutions and SVG Animation Support

You're facing a common challenge when transitioning from GIF-based terminal recordings to more modern video formats for PowerPoint presentations [^1][^3]. While animated SVGs offer excellent quality and small file sizes, PowerPoint's support for SVG animations remains limited, making video conversion the most reliable approach [^6][^11].

## Current State of Animated SVG Support in PowerPoint

PowerPoint's animated SVG support has improved significantly in recent versions, but compatibility remains inconsistent [^6][^21]. PowerPoint 365 offers the best SVG animation support, while earlier versions like PowerPoint 2013 provide only limited functionality [^6][^33]. However, even in the latest versions, SVG animations may not display consistently across different presentation environments [^11][^29].

The most reliable approach for professional presentations is converting your terminal recordings to MP4 video format, which provides excellent compatibility across all PowerPoint versions [^18][^21][^33].

## Recommended Video Conversion Solutions

Based on extensive research into terminal recording conversion methods, three primary solutions stand out for converting your .cast files to PowerPoint-compatible video formats [^1][^14][^20].

Terminal Recording to PowerPoint Conversion Workflow

### Option 1: Docker-Based MP4 Conversion (Recommended)

The easiest and most reliable solution uses the beer5215/asciicast2mp4 Docker container, which provides direct .cast to MP4 conversion [^20]. This method requires minimal setup and produces high-quality MP4 files that work seamlessly with PowerPoint [^20][^21]. The conversion process involves pulling the Docker image and running a single command with your .cast file [^20].

### Option 2: Official agg Tool for GIF Output

The asciinema team has developed agg as the official successor to asciicast2gif, addressing many of the limitations of the deprecated tool [^14][^15][^17]. This Rust-based tool produces optimized, high-quality GIF files with accurate frame timing [^14][^16]. While requiring more setup than the Docker solution, agg provides excellent control over output quality and file size [^15][^19].

### Option 3: VHS for Professional-Grade Videos

VHS by Charm represents a modern approach to terminal recording, generating videos directly rather than requiring post-processing conversion [^25]. This tool uses .tape script files to define recording sessions and produces high-quality MP4, GIF, or WebM outputs [^25]. VHS offers the best video quality and most professional results for presentation use [^25].

## Implementation Guide

### Docker MP4 Conversion Setup

The Docker-based approach requires installing Docker and pulling the conversion container [^20]. Once set up, conversion involves placing your .cast file in the working directory and running the Docker container with volume mounting [^20]. The process typically produces a result.mp4 file within minutes [^20].

### agg Installation and Usage

Installing agg requires the Rust toolchain and Cargo package manager [^15]. After installation, the tool accepts various customization options including font size, color themes, and output optimization [^14][^16]. The resulting GIF files integrate seamlessly with PowerPoint's image insertion functionality [^6].

### VHS Implementation

VHS installation varies by platform but generally involves downloading a binary or using package managers like Homebrew [^25]. Unlike other solutions, VHS uses .tape script files that define the terminal interaction sequence [^25]. This approach provides the highest level of control over the final video output [^25].

## PowerPoint Integration Best Practices

### Video Format Optimization

PowerPoint 2013 and later versions provide best compatibility with MP4 files encoded using H.264 video and AAC audio [^21][^33]. These formats support autoplay functionality, looping, and embedded playback without external dependencies [^18][^29]. Older formats like AVI and WMV still work but produce larger file sizes [^33][^35].

### Autoplay and Loop Configuration

Modern PowerPoint versions allow extensive video playback customization [^18][^26][^29]. The Playback tab provides options for automatic start, loop until stopped, and rewind after playing [^18][^26]. These settings ensure smooth presentation flow without manual intervention [^29].

### File Size Management

Video file sizes can become problematic for presentation sharing and storage [^21][^35]. Compression using FFmpeg with appropriate quality settings can reduce file sizes significantly while maintaining visual clarity [^21]. GIF outputs from agg typically range from 500KB to 2MB, while MP4 conversions may produce 2MB to 10MB files [^21].

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Playback Problems

Video playback issues in PowerPoint often stem from codec compatibility or file location problems [^18][^35]. Ensuring MP4 files use H.264 encoding and keeping video files in the same directory as the presentation resolves most compatibility issues [^21][^35]. Updating PowerPoint to the latest version also addresses many codec-related problems [^35].

### Performance Optimization

Large video files can impact presentation performance, particularly when multiple recordings are embedded [^21][^35]. Using compressed MP4 formats or optimized GIF outputs helps maintain smooth playback [^21]. For presentations requiring multiple terminal recordings, consider using lower resolution settings or shorter recording durations [^21].

### Cross-Platform Compatibility

When sharing presentations across different systems, MP4 format provides the most reliable playback experience [^21][^33]. SVG animations may not display consistently on older PowerPoint versions or different operating systems [^6][^11]. Testing presentations on target systems before important presentations ensures compatibility [^35].

The transition from asciicast2gif to modern video conversion tools represents a significant improvement in both quality and compatibility for PowerPoint presentations [^17][^20]. Docker-based conversion offers the simplest implementation path, while tools like agg and VHS provide additional customization options for specific presentation requirements [^14][^20][^25].
